# F1 Data analysis 

For this 1st Project in Preprocessing in Kaggle dediced to chose a database in Kaggle about Formula Historical Data from 1950s to 2023. The reason I chose this dataset was because I followed this sport really close and being able to give a deep look into some statistics would be interesting due to all the data that is available.

Dataset belongs to Volani which made a solid work with the web scraping through a database of F1 Championships standinds, points, races and invidual stats from Formula 1 drivers. However this is not a good dataset yet since it has some issues with naming of drivers and some data it has missing fields.

My contributions was towards highlighting important remarks across the history, as well as pointing data that would be more to eye of a casual viewer of formula 1.
